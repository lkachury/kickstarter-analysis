# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Using Excel and Kickstarter data to analyze outcomes based on goals and launch date.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to determine how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals given that Louiseâ€™s theater play achieved its fundraising goal relatively quickly after launch. Using the provided Kickstarter dataset, theater campaign outcomes based on the play's launch dates and funding goals will be visualized.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The chart above visualizes the theater outcomes based on launch dates. From the chart we can see that May was the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter theater campaigns while January, June, July and October all had a similar amount of failed launched campaigns. A similar amount of projects were canceled throughput the year, except in Octobe. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results



* From the parent category and subcategory pivot charts, we found that the "theater" category and the "plays" subcategory have been the most successful Kickstarter campaigns.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
