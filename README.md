* From the parent category and subcategory pivot charts, we found that the "theater" category and the "plays" subcategory have been the most successful Kickstarter campaigns.

* From the line pivot chart, we found that May was the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns while January, June, July and October all had a similar amount of failed launched campaigns.

* From the box and whisker plot, we found that 4,000 is the mean campaign goal for musicals in Great Britain. However, this value is an outlier based on the upper range of amounts pledged (3,500). If Louise wants to create a future project in Great Britain, she should lower her costs and production budet to under $4,000. (Of Note, currency should be Â£).
