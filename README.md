### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

* From the line pivot chart, we found that May was the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns while January, June, July and October all had a similar amount of failed launched campaigns. 

* From the parent category and subcategory pivot charts, we found that the "theater" category and the "plays" subcategory have been the most successful Kickstarter campaigns.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
